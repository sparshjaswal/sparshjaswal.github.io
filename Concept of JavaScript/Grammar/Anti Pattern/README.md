# Anti-Pattern

## Some most common anti-patterns in JavaScript are the following:-

### Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global context

### Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as this

### triggers the use of eval() internally.

### Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)

### Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible

### The use of the document.write where native DOM alternatives such as document.createElement are more appropriate. document.write has been grossly misused over the years and has quite a few disadvantages including that if it's executed after the page has been loaded it can actually overwrite the page you're on, whilst document.createElement does not. You can see here for a live example of this in action. It also doesn't work with XHTML which is another reason opting for more DOM-friendly methods such as document.createElement is favorable
