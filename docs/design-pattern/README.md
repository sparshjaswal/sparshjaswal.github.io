## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a shared vocabulary for developers to communicate complex design concepts efficiently.

> 💡 **Think of design patterns as blueprints** - they show you how to structure your code to solve recurring problems in an elegant and maintainable way.

## Benefits of Design Patterns

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚀 **Accelerated Development** | Proven solutions speed up the development process |
| 🔄 **Reusability** | Solutions can be applied across different projects |
| 📖 **Improved Communication** | Common vocabulary for developers and architects |
| 🛡️ **Robust Design** | Helps prevent subtle bugs and design flaws |
| 🎯 **Problem-Solution Clarity** | Clear mapping between problems and their solutions |
| 🏗️ **Better Architecture** | Promotes loose coupling and high cohesion |

## Pattern Categories

### 🏗️ [Creational Patterns](./docs/creational-patterns.md)
*Deal with object creation mechanisms*
- **Factory Method** - Create objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory** - Create families of related objects  
- **Builder** - Construct complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Clone existing objects
- **Singleton** - Ensure only one instance exists

### 🔗 [Structural Patterns](./docs/structural-patterns.md)
*Deal with object composition and relationships*
- **Adapter** - Make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Bridge** - Separate abstraction from implementation
- **Composite** - Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Decorator** - Add behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade** - Provide simplified interface to complex systems
- **Flyweight** - Share objects efficiently to minimize memory usage

### 🔄 [Behavioral Patterns](./docs/behavioral-patterns.md)
*Deal with communication between objects and algorithms*
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Pass requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command** - Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Iterator** - Traverse elements of a collection
- **Mediator** - Define how objects interact with each other
- **Observer** - Notify multiple objects about state changes
- **Strategy** - Select algorithms at runtime
- **Template Method** - Define algorithm skeleton, let subclasses override steps
