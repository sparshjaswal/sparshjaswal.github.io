# Data Structures and Algorithms Pattern Guide

A comprehensive collection of algorithmic patterns and techniques for coding interviews and competitive programming, organized into separate folders for easy navigation.

## üìÅ Pattern Directories

Each pattern is organized in its own directory under `./dsa-trick/` with detailed explanations, concepts, and problem lists.

### [01. Fast and Slow Pointer](./dsa-trick/01-Fast-and-Slow-Pointer/)
Use two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles and solve related problems.

### [02. Overlapping Intervals](./dsa-trick/02-Overlapping-Intervals/)
Sort and merge intervals to handle overlapping ranges and scheduling problems.

### [03. Prefix Sum](./dsa-trick/03-Prefix-Sum/)
Leverage cumulative sums or products for efficient range queries and subarray calculations.

### [04. Sliding Window](./dsa-trick/04-Sliding-Window/)
Move a window over the input to solve subarray or substring problems in linear time.

### [05. Two Pointers](./dsa-trick/05-Two-Pointers/)
Use two indices traversing the input for efficient array and string processing.

### [06. Cyclic Sort](./dsa-trick/06-Cyclic-Sort/)
Sort arrays with consecutive numbers using index-based swaps.

### [07. Reversal of Linked List](./dsa-trick/07-Reversal-of-Linked-List/)

### [09. Breadth First Search](./dsa-trick/09-Breadth-First-Search/)
Explore graphs or trees level by level using queues.

### [10. Depth First Search](./dsa-trick/10-Depth-First-Search/)
Traverse deeply into structures using recursion or stacks.

### [11. Backtracking](./dsa-trick/11-Backtracking/)
Systematically explore all possible solutions using recursion and backtracking.

### [12. Modified Binary Search](./dsa-trick/12-Modified-Binary-Search/)
Adapt binary search for rotated arrays, special conditions, or custom comparators.

### [13. Bitwise XOR](./dsa-trick/13-Bitwise-XOR/)
Apply XOR operations for efficient pairing, unique element detection, and bit manipulation.

### [14. Top 'K' Elements](./dsa-trick/14-Top-K-Elements/)
Find the top K elements using heaps or priority queues.

### [15. K-way Merge](./dsa-trick/15-K-way-Merge/)
Merge multiple sorted lists efficiently using heaps.

### [16. Two Heaps](./dsa-trick/16-Two-Heaps/)
Maintain two heaps for dynamic median and range queries.

### [17. Monotonic Stack](./dsa-trick/17-Monotonic-Stack/)
Use stacks that maintain increasing or decreasing order for range and span queries.

### [18. Trees](./dsa-trick/18-Trees/)
Solve hierarchical data structure problems with various tree traversals and manipulations.

### [19. Dynamic Programming](./dsa-trick/19-Dynamic-Programming/)
Break complex problems into overlapping subproblems for optimal solutions.

### [20. Graphs](./dsa-trick/20-Graphs/)
Apply graph traversal, shortest path, and connectivity algorithms.

### [21. Greedy](./dsa-trick/21-Greedy/)
Make locally optimal choices to achieve a global optimum.

### [22. Design Data Structure](./dsa-trick/22-Design-Data-Structure/)
Build custom data structures for specialized operations and performance.

## üéØ How to Use This Guide

1. **Identify the Pattern:** Analyze the problem and match it to a pattern.
2. **Study the Concept:** Read the overview and templates in the relevant directory.
3. **Practice Problems:** Work through the curated problems for each pattern.
4. **Recognize Variations:** Notice when problems are variations or combinations of known patterns.

## üìö Pattern Recognition Tips

- **Keywords:** Look for terms like "cycle", "sorted", "subarray", etc.
- **Constraints:** Problem constraints often hint at the right pattern.
- **Examples:** Study sample inputs/outputs for structural clues.
- **Complexity:** Time/space requirements can guide your pattern choice.

## üöÄ Study Strategy

1. **Master Core Patterns:** Start with fundamentals like Two Pointers and Sliding Window.
2. **Practice Consistently:** Solve 2‚Äì3 problems per pattern before moving on.
3. **Focus on Understanding:** Grasp the concepts, don‚Äôt just memorize solutions.
4. **Review Regularly:** Revisit patterns to reinforce your knowledge.
5. **Combine Patterns:** Advanced problems often require multiple patterns.
