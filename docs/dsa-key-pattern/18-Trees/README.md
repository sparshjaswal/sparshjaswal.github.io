# Trees

## Description
Tree problems involve hierarchical data structures and various traversal techniques.

## Time Complexity
O(n) for most traversals

## Space Complexity
O(h) where h is height of tree

## Key Concepts
- **Tree Traversal**: Inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order
- **Recursive Structure**: Most tree problems solved recursively
- **Tree Construction**: Build trees from traversals or arrays
- **Path Problems**: Find paths with specific properties

## Categories

## Level Order Traversal (BFS in Binary Tree)
**Key Problems:**
- Level order Traversal
- Zigzag Level order Traversal
- Even Odd Tree
- Reverse odd Levels
- Deepest Leaves Sum
- Add one row to Tree
- Maximum width of Binary Tree
- All Nodes Distance K in Binary tree

## Tree Construction
**Description:** Build binary trees from given traversal sequences or arrays.

**Key Problems:**
- Construct BT from Preorder and Inorder
- Construct BT from Postorder and Inorder
- Maximum Binary Tree
- Construct BST from Preorder

**Pattern:** Use recursive divide-and-conquer approach with traversal properties.

## Height related Problems
**Description:** Problems involving tree height, depth, balance, and diameter.

**Key Problems:**
- Maximum Depth of BT
- Balanced Binary Tree
- Diameter of Binary Tree
- Minimum Depth of BT

**Pattern:** Use recursion to calculate height and compare subtrees.

## Root to leaf path problems
**Description:** Problems involving paths from root to leaf nodes.

**Key Problems:**
- Binary Tree Paths
- Path Sum II
- Sum Root to Leaf numbers
- Smallest string starting from Leaf
- Insufficient nodes in root to Leaf
- Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree
- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

**Pattern:** Use backtracking or DFS to explore all root-to-leaf paths.

## Ancestor problem
**Description:** Problems involving relationships between ancestors and descendants.

**Key Problems:**
- LCA of Binary Tree
- Maximum difference between node and ancestor
- LCA of deepest leaves
- Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node

**Pattern:** Use parent pointers, path tracking, or recursive LCA algorithms.

## Binary Search Tree
**Description:** Problems specific to BST properties and operations.

**Key Problems:**
- Validate BST
- Range Sum of BST
- Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
- Insert into a BST
- LCA of BST

**Pattern:** Leverage BST property (left < root < right) for efficient solutions.
