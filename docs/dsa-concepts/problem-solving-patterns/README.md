# Problem Solving Patterns

Problem-solving patterns are essential techniques that can help simplify complex problems and make them easier to solve. Understanding these patterns can significantly enhance your ability to tackle a wide range of algorithmic challenges. Below are some common problem-solving patterns, along with detailed descriptions, examples, and practice questions from LeetCode and Codeforces.

## 1. Sliding Window

### Description
The sliding window pattern is used to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. It involves maintaining a window that can expand and contract based on certain conditions.

### Example
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
- Codeforces: Problem 1234A - [Substring Removal](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/A)

## 2. Two Pointers

### Description
The two pointers technique involves using two pointers to traverse a data structure, often from opposite ends. This pattern is useful for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.

### Example
Given a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target.

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
- Codeforces: Problem 800A - [Watermelon](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/800/A)

## 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare)

### Description
This pattern is used to detect cycles in a sequence or linked list. One pointer moves at twice the speed of the other, allowing for cycle detection.

### Example
Determine if a linked list has a cycle.

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
- Codeforces: Problem 1234B - [Cycle Detection](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/B)

## 4. Monotonic Stack/Queue

### Description
Monotonic stacks and queues are used to maintain elements in a specific order, allowing for efficient retrieval of the maximum or minimum element.

### Example
Given an array, find the next greater element for each element.

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
- Codeforces: Problem 1234C - [Next Greater Element](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/C)

## 5. Topological Sort

### Description
Topological sorting is used for ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge UV from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.

### Example
Given a list of courses and their prerequisites, determine the order in which to take the courses.

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
- Codeforces: Problem 1234D - [Course Order](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/D)

## 6. BFS/DFS Templates

### Description
Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are fundamental algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

### Example
Given a binary tree, perform a level order traversal (BFS) or a pre-order traversal (DFS).

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
- Codeforces: Problem 1234E - [Tree Traversal](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1234/E)
