# Advanced Topics in Data Structures and Algorithms

## Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

### Description
The Disjoint Set data structure, also known as Union-Find, is used to keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It supports two primary operations:
- **Union**: Merging two subsets into a single subset.
- **Find**: Determining which subset a particular element is in.

### Applications
- Network connectivity
- Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm
- Image processing (connected components)

### Example
Consider a scenario where we have a set of elements and we want to group them into connected components. Using the Union-Find structure, we can efficiently merge groups and check connectivity.

## String Algorithms

### Description
String algorithms are essential for processing and analyzing strings. They include various techniques for searching, matching, and manipulating strings.

### Key Algorithms
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: Efficient substring search algorithm.
- **Rabin-Karp**: Uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text.
- **Z-algorithm**: Computes the Z-array for pattern matching.

### Applications
- Text processing
- DNA sequencing
- Search engines

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)
- Codeforces: [String Similarity](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1352/A)

## Geometry Algorithms

### Description
Geometry algorithms deal with geometric objects and their properties. They are crucial in computer graphics, robotics, and geographic information systems (GIS).

### Key Algorithms
- **Convex Hull**: Finding the smallest convex polygon that can enclose a set of points.
- **Line Intersection**: Determining if two lines intersect and finding the intersection point.
- **Closest Pair of Points**: Finding the two closest points in a set.

### Applications
- Computer graphics
- Geographic information systems
- Robotics

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [Minimum Area Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle/)
- Codeforces: [Geometry Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1000/A)

## Number Theory

### Description
Number theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers.

### Key Concepts
- **Prime Numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An efficient algorithm to find all primes up to a specified integer.
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder.

### Applications
- Cryptography
- Algorithm optimization
- Combinatorial problems

### Practice Questions
- LeetCode: [GCD of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/gcd-of-strings/)
- Codeforces: [GCD Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1000/B)
