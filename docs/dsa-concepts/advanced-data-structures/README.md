# Advanced Data Structures

## Overview

Advanced data structures are essential for efficiently managing and organizing data in complex applications. They provide the foundation for various algorithms and are crucial for solving intricate problems in computer science. This section covers several advanced data structures, including trees, graphs, and hashing, along with their types, applications, and practice problems.

## 1. Trees

### Description
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and may have links to other nodes (children). The top node is called the root, and nodes without children are called leaves.

### Types of Trees
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent node, and the right child is greater.
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A balanced binary search tree with an additional property of color.
- **B-tree**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.
- **Segment Tree**: A tree used for storing intervals or segments.
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: A data structure that provides efficient methods for cumulative frequency tables.

### Applications
- Databases (B-trees)
- File systems (directory structures)
- Compilers (syntax trees)
- Networking (routing algorithms)

### Practice Problems
- LeetCode: [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)
- Codeforces: [Tree Diameter](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/114/A)

## 2. Graphs

### Description
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and cyclic or acyclic.

### Representations
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where the cell at row i and column j indicates the presence of an edge between vertices i and j.
- **Adjacency List**: An array of lists where each list corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of its adjacent vertices.

### Applications
- Social networks
- Maps and navigation systems
- Network routing algorithms

### Practice Problems
- LeetCode: [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
- Codeforces: [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/20/C)

## 3. Hashing

### Description
Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It involves using a hash function to convert input data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code.

### Hash Tables
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

### Collision Resolution Techniques
- **Chaining**: Each cell in the hash table points to a linked list of entries that hash to the same index.
- **Open Addressing**: All elements are stored in the hash table itself, and when a collision occurs, the algorithm finds another open slot.

### Applications
- Caches
- Databases
- Sets and dictionaries

### Practice Problems
- LeetCode: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- Codeforces: [Hashing](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1360/B)
